# 360Giving Data Vis Challenge
This repo holds the data I used for the 360Giving data vis challenge and some screenshots which show how the 'dots' visuals can be used to get insights into who funds what, where.


# Themes
I created the themes by searchingfor keywords in the Grantnav awards descriptions. Some themes use only one keyword. Others, like 'youth' are a combination of similar words; in this case 'youth', 'young', 'adolescent' etc.


# Countries
The countries were also found by searching the descriptions.
